    The history of Saveetha Hospital is intertwined with the expansion of the broader Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMATS), founded by Dr. N.M. Veeraiyan. 
1986: The journey began with the creation of the Saveetha Medical and Educational Trust, established to provide medical relief, education, and research.
1988: The Trust established the Saveetha Dental College and an attached general hospital, which started with 100 beds. This marked the formal beginning of healthcare services.
2005: The Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Sciences (SIMATS) was officially declared a "Deemed to be University" by the Government of India, bringing the existing colleges (Dental, Nursing, and Physiotherapy) under one umbrella.
2008: The dedicated Saveetha Medical College and Hospital was established to train doctors and provide tertiary care. The hospital has since grown significantly into a 1200-bedded free hospital equipped with advanced technology and super-specialty facilities. 
The hospital has been recognized for its performance, including being ranked among the top five private hospitals in India for COVID-19 treatment during the pandemic, and achieving Guinness World Records for community health initiatives like mass CPR training.
